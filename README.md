This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Set Up Environment Variables

This app requires API keys for the following platforms:

API Ninjas
OpenWeatherMap
Instructions to Get API Keys
API Ninjas:

Sign up or log in to API Ninjas.
Navigate to the API Keys section to generate a key.
Copy the API key.
OpenWeatherMap:

Sign up or log in to OpenWeatherMap.
Navigate to API Keys in your dashboard.
Generate an API key and copy it.

Create a .env File
In the root directory of the project, create a file named .env and define your API keys:

env
Copy code
GEOCODING_URL=https://api.api-ninjas.com/v1/geocoding
GEOCODING_API_KEY=your_api_ninjas_api_key
OPEN_WEATHER_MAP_URL=https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather
OPEN_WEATHER_MAP_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key

Declare Environment Variables
If you are using TypeScript, update the @env module declaration:

typescript
Copy code
declare module '@env' {
export const GEOCODING_URL: string;
export const GEOCODING_API_KEY: string;
export const OPEN_WEATHER_MAP_URL: string;
export const OPEN_WEATHER_MAP_API_KEY: string;
}

## Step 2: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start --reset-cache

# OR using Yarn
yarn start --reset-cache
```

## Step 3: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

Atomic Design Structure
This project follows the Atomic Design methodology to organize components for better scalability:

Atoms: Basic UI elements.
Molecules: Groups of atoms .
Organisms: Complex UI sections.

## Congratulations! :tada:
